# AirBnB Listings Analysis

## Overview

For this project, I analyzed the `airbnb_listings.csv` dataset, which consists of 7,566 AirBnB listings. This dataset includes a wide range of both qualitative and quantitative variables (75 columns in total), such as listing amenities, review ratings, neighborhoods, and availability.

The project is divided into two main parts:

### Part 1: Data Exploration and Visualization

In this section, I highlighted trends and insights from the dataset using various plotting libraries. I explored the data to uncover patterns and relationships within the AirBnB listings. The visualizations help in understanding key aspects like pricing trends, popular neighborhoods, and the impact of amenities on listing success.

### Part 2: Command Line Interface for Data Analysis

In the second part, I developed a command line interface (CLI) that allows users to perform their own analysis of the AirBnB dataset. Through this CLI, users can enter queries to explore different aspects of the dataset. This part of the project demonstrates my ability to create expressive and complex programs using Python.

For the CLI, I used scripting mode (.py files) to ensure ease of use directly from the terminal. Users can input various commands to filter and analyze the data based on their interests, providing a dynamic and interactive way to engage with the dataset.


## Conclusion

This project showcases my ability to perform data analysis and create interactive tools using Python. The combination of data visualization and a command line interface provides a comprehensive approach to understanding the AirBnB listings dataset.
